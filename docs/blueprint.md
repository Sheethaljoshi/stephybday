- Password Protection: Implement password protection on the landing page using Javascript, with password clues displayed interactively.
- Meme Carousel: Display a carousel of memes with captions and inside jokes. Use a JavaScript library for smooth transitions.
- Interactive Letters: Show heartfelt letters within modals or accordions, triggered by button clicks with animated transitions.
- AI-Powered Time Machine: Generates an image of the friend group in 50 years, with the LLM reasoning like a tool as to what aspects of the image will need to change to match that time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pastel pink (#FFB6C1) for a cheerful and sentimental feel.
- Background color: Very light pastel pink (#FDE2E4). The desaturation keeps the brightness under control for comfortable reading, and is still in keeping with the sentimental theme.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel; suitable for body text. Headlines use the same font.
- Use playful, custom icons related to each section (e.g., meme icon, letter icon, photo icon).
- Mobile-friendly layout with smooth scrolling between sections. Use modals and collapsible accordions to manage content.
- Gentle animations for transitions, hovers, and reveals. Include confetti bursts or sparkle effects.
